            These Terms are a simple placeholder for now. This private atelier is invite-only and
            access is granted personally. Please be kind, keep conversations warm, and do not share
            access links or content outside the app. All works remain the property of Kareevsky and
            are shared here for personal enjoyment and connection.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '12px' }}>
            A detailed Terms version will be added soon. If you have questions, reach out through
            the in-app messages after you enter.
